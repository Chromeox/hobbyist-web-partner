🔧 PROVISIONING PROFILE CAPABILITY MISMATCH FIX
===============================================

XCODE WANTS: App Groups, Associated Domains, HealthKit, Push Notifications, Sign in with Apple
YOUR PROFILE HAS: App Groups, Associated Domains, HealthKit, In-App Purchase, Push Notifications, Sign In with Apple

ISSUE: App Groups configuration mismatch

SOLUTION STEPS:

1. CHECK APP GROUPS IN APPLE DEVELOPER CONSOLE
   - Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/applicationGroup
   - Verify "group.com.hobbyist.app" exists and is active
   - If not, create it with identifier: group.com.hobbyist.app

2. CHECK APP ID CONFIGURATION
   - Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list
   - Find "com.hobbyist.bookingapp"
   - Edit it and verify these capabilities are enabled:
     ✅ App Groups (and "group.com.hobbyist.app" is selected)
     ✅ Associated Domains
     ✅ HealthKit
     ✅ In-App Purchase
     ✅ Push Notifications
     ✅ Sign In with Apple

3. RECREATE PROVISIONING PROFILE
   - Delete "Hobbyist App - New Provision"
   - Create new one with ALL these capabilities:
     ✅ App Groups (select group.com.hobbyist.app)
     ✅ Associated Domains
     ✅ HealthKit
     ✅ In-App Purchase (needed for Apple Sign In)
     ✅ Push Notifications
     ✅ Sign In with Apple

4. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL
   - Download new profile
   - Double-click to install
   - Select in Xcode

ROOT CAUSE:
Your entitlements file references "group.com.hobbyist.app" but this specific
app group might not be properly associated with your App ID or provisioning profile.

QUICK FIX:
Since you might not actually need App Groups for Apple Sign In, you could
temporarily remove the App Groups section from your entitlements file to test
Apple Sign In, then add it back later if needed.
