🔧 XCODE PROVISIONING PROFILE FIX
=================================

PROBLEM: Xcode not recognizing In-App Purchase entitlement in your provisioning profile
SOLUTION: Force refresh Xcode's provisioning profile cache

STEP 1: Clear Xcode Provisioning Profile Cache
-----------------------------------------------
1. Quit Xcode completely
2. Open Terminal and run these commands:

   cd ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\ Profiles
   rm *.mobileprovision

   # Clear Xcode derived data
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*

STEP 2: Re-download Provisioning Profile
-----------------------------------------
1. Go back to Apple Developer Console
2. Re-download your "Hobbyist App - New Provision" profile
3. Double-click the downloaded .mobileprovision file to install

STEP 3: Configure Xcode Project
--------------------------------
1. Open Xcode
2. Go to your project → Signing & Capabilities
3. For BOTH Debug AND Release:
   - Turn OFF "Automatically manage signing"
   - Select "Hobbyist App - New Provision" profile manually
   - Verify Team is set to "Quantum Hobbyist Group Inc."

STEP 4: Verify Entitlements
----------------------------
1. In project navigator, select your .entitlements file
2. Verify these entries exist:
   ✅ com.apple.developer.applesignin
   ✅ com.apple.developer.in-app-purchase

STEP 5: Clean Build
-------------------
1. Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. Build project
3. Test Apple Sign In

ALTERNATIVE: Re-create Provisioning Profile
--------------------------------------------
If the above doesn't work:
1. Delete "Hobbyist App - New Provision" from Apple Developer Console
2. Create a brand new one with a different name
3. Ensure In-App Purchase is checked
4. Download and install the new profile

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
- Xcode caches provisioning profiles locally
- Sometimes the cache gets out of sync with Apple's servers
- Force refreshing resolves most provisioning issues
