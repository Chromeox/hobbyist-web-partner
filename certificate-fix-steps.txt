🔧 CERTIFICATE-PROVISIONING PROFILE FIX
========================================

PROBLEM: Your provisioning profile doesn't include the specific certificate

CERTIFICATES FOUND IN KEYCHAIN:
✅ Apple Development: Kurt Cuffy (S44X32236J) - TWO COPIES
✅ Apple Distribution: Quantum Hobbyist Group Inc.
✅ Developer ID Application: Quantum Hobbyist Group Inc.

QUICK FIX - TRY AUTOMATIC SIGNING FIRST:
-----------------------------------------
1. In Xcode → Signing & Capabilities
2. For Debug: Turn ON "Automatically manage signing"
3. Xcode should automatically match certificate with capabilities
4. Test Apple Sign In immediately!

IF AUTOMATIC SIGNING WORKS:
- You can test Apple Sign In right now
- Then create proper manual profile later if needed

MANUAL FIX - RECREATE PROVISIONING PROFILE:
--------------------------------------------
1. Go to Apple Developer Console → Profiles
2. Delete "Hobbyist App Provisioning Profile"
3. Create NEW profile:
   - Type: iOS App Development
   - App ID: com.hobbyist.bookingapp
   - Certificate: SELECT "Apple Development: Kurt Cuffy (S44X32236J)"
   - Devices: Your test devices
   - Capabilities: VERIFY In-App Purchase is checked
4. Download new profile
5. Use in Xcode

ROOT CAUSE:
When you created the provisioning profile, it might not have included
the specific certificate, or there's confusion with duplicate certificates.

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
Try automatic signing first - if it works, you can test Apple Sign In
immediately and deal with manual profiles later.
