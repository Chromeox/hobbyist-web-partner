🍎 APPLE SIGN IN - SIMPLE FIX APPROACH
=====================================

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Debug with automatic signing: ✅ WORKING
- Release with manual/automatic signing: ❌ FAILING (In-App Purchase issue)

SIMPLE SOLUTION: Use Debug Configuration for Testing
----------------------------------------------------
Since Debug is working perfectly with Apple Sign In, let's just use that for testing:

1. In Xcode → Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme
2. For "Run" action: Change "Build Configuration" from "Debug" to "Debug" (keep it)
3. Test Apple Sign In in Debug mode - it should work!

DEBUG CONFIGURATION ADVANTAGES:
✅ Automatic signing working perfectly
✅ In-App Purchase entitlement included automatically
✅ Apple Sign In functional
✅ No provisioning profile headaches

ALTERNATIVE: Force Release to use Debug settings
-------------------------------------------------
1. In Build Settings → Search "CODE_SIGN"
2. Set Release configuration to match Debug exactly:
   - Code Signing Identity: "Apple Development"
   - Code Signing Style: "Automatic"
   - Development Team: "Quantum Hobbyist Group Inc."

WHY THIS WORKS:
For Apple Sign In testing, Debug vs Release doesn't matter much.
The key is having the In-App Purchase entitlement, which Debug has.

LONG-TERM SOLUTION:
Once Apple Sign In is working and tested, we can revisit proper
Release configuration for App Store submission later.

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
Test Apple Sign In in Debug mode right now - it should work perfectly
since Debug configuration already has all required entitlements!
