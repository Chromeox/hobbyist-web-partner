🔧 SUPABASE APPLE SIGN IN - AUDIENCE MISMATCH FIX
===============================================

PROBLEM: Apple sending App ID (com.hobbyist.bookingapp) but Supabase expects Service ID

SOLUTION: Update Supabase Configuration

GO TO SUPABASE DASHBOARD:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mcjqvdzdhtcvbrejvrtp/auth/providers

APPLE PROVIDER SETTINGS - CHANGE:
---------------------------------
CURRENT:
- Client ID: com.hobbyist.bookingapp.service

CHANGE TO:
- Client ID: com.hobbyist.bookingapp

KEEP SAME:
- Client Secret: (same JWT we generated)

WHY THIS WORKS:
iOS apps send the App ID as the audience, not the Service ID.
The Service ID is used for web/backend authentication.
For iOS native apps, use the App ID as the Client ID in Supabase.

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
If you want to use Service ID for backend consistency, you need to
configure the Apple Service ID to include your App ID in its primary
app ID configuration.

IMMEDIATE FIX:
Change Supabase Client ID from:
❌ com.hobbyist.bookingapp.service
TO:
✅ com.hobbyist.bookingapp

This should immediately resolve the audience mismatch error!
