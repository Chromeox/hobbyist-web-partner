🔄 XCODE CACHE REFRESH COMPLETE
===============================

CACHE CLEARED:
✅ Provisioning Profiles cache
✅ Derived Data cache
✅ Xcode application caches
✅ Xcode process terminated

NEXT STEPS:

1. RE-DOWNLOAD PROVISIONING PROFILE
   - Go back to Apple Developer Console
   - Download "Hobbyist App Provisioning Profile" again
   - Double-click to install (this ensures fresh copy)

2. RESTART AND CONFIGURE XCODE
   - Open Xcode
   - Open your HobbyistSwiftUI project
   - Go to Signing & Capabilities
   - Turn OFF "Automatically manage signing"
   - Select "Hobbyist App Provisioning Profile" manually
   - Verify it shows no errors

3. ALTERNATIVE: TRY AUTO-SIGNING FIRST
   - For Debug: Turn ON "Automatically manage signing"
   - This might just work now with cleared cache
   - If it works, test Apple Sign In immediately!

4. FINAL VERIFICATION
   - Clean Build (Cmd+Shift+K)
   - Build and Run
   - Test Apple Sign In button

WHY THIS SHOULD WORK:
- Your provisioning profile IS correct (has In-App Purchase ✅)
- Your certificate IS installed
- Cache was preventing Xcode from seeing the match
- Fresh restart should resolve the connection

FALLBACK PLAN:
If still having issues, we can try creating the certificate
through Xcode itself using automatic signing, then export
the working profile for manual use.
