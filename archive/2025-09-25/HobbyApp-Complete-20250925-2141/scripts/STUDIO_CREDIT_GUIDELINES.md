```

## Pricing Strategy Tips

### Maximize Revenue
1. **Price at the top of your tier range** - If your class fits 10 credits, price it at $50 rather than $35
2. **Bundle related skills** - Combine techniques to justify higher credit tiers
3. **Offer progression paths** - Start students at 6-8 credits, then upsell to 10-12 credit advanced classes
4. **Create premium experiences** - 15-credit intensives with special materials, small groups, or extended time

### Student Retention
1. **Consistent pricing** - Use the same credit tier for similar classes
2. **Clear value communication** - Explain what students get for their credits
3. **Progressive skill building** - Design class series that use increasing credit values
4. **Special workshops** - Use 15-credit tier for unique, high-value experiences

## Marketing Your Classes

### Directory Listings
- Emphasize **value and experience** over just technique
- Highlight **unique aspects** that justify your credit tier

- Include **beautiful photos** that showcase the creative process

### Credit Tier Messaging

- **12 Credits**: "Master advanced techniques"
- **15 Credits**: "Intensive learning experience"

## FAQs for Studios

### Q: Can I change my credit requirements?
**A:** Yes, but try to maintain consistency. If you need to adjust, communicate changes to regular students and update your Airtable listings.

### Q: What if my class doesn't fit exactly into a tier?
**A:** Choose the tier that best matches your class value. Consider the total experience, not just time duration. A 1-hour intensive workshop with expensive materials might warrant 10-12 credits.

### Q: How do I handle class series or packages?
**A:** List individual classes with their credit requirements. Students can book single sessions or multiple sessions as desired. Consider offering "intensive" versions for higher credit tiers.

### Q: Can I offer discounts or promotions?
**A:** The credit system handles promotions at the platform level (seasonal bonuses, first-time user discounts, etc.). Focus on creating value that justifies your chosen credit tier.

### Q: How does payment work?
**A:** Students pre-purchase credits and book your classes. You receive payment weekly via Stripe Connect based on classes attended. The platform handles all payment processing, refunds, and customer service.
