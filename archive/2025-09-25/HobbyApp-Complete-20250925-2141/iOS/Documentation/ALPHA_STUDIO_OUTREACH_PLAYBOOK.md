I'm setting aside time this week to personally onboard our founding

15-minute setup call?

Best,
[Your Name]
P.S. - I'm only accepting 10 studios for alpha, and we already have 
6 confirmed. Let me know by [Day] to secure your spot!

Hi [Name],

Quick update - we now have 8 of 10 alpha studios confirmed, 
including [Competitor Studio] and [Other Known Studio].

I'm holding a spot for [Studio Name] until end of day tomorrow 
because I genuinely think you'd be perfect for this program.

If now isn't the right time, no worries! But the founding partner 
pricing (50% off forever) is only available for these first 10 studios.

Here's the signup link one more time: [LINK]

Or just reply with "YES" and I'll get you set up!
