## 📝 SCRIPT FOR ASSISTED SIGNUP

### **Transition to Signup**

**You:** "You know what? Since you're interested and I'm here, let me get you set up right now - it literally takes 60 seconds and saves us both time later."

*[Pull out your phone confidently]*

**You:** "I'll start filling this out while we chat, then you can add your contact details."

---

### **While Filling Form Together**

**You:** "So you're [Studio Name]... and you mentioned you're the [owner/manager]..."

*[Start typing their info as you confirm]*

**Studio Owner:** "Yes, that's right."

**You:** "Perfect. And you said you run about [X] classes per week?"

*[Keep filling while maintaining conversation]*

**You:** "This is great - you'll actually be our [8th] founding studio. [Other Studio Name] just joined yesterday and they're already seeing bookings."

---

### **Hand Over for Contact Info**

**You:** "Okay, I just need your email and phone for the TestFlight invitation..."

*[Hand them your phone]*

**You:** "While you're typing that, I should mention - the TestFlight invite will come from Apple, not us, so check your spam if you don't see it within an hour."

---

### **After They Submit**

*[Take phone back, show confirmation screen]*

**You:** "Perfect! You're officially locked in as a founding partner. Let me text you right now so you have my direct number..."

*[Send text immediately]*

**Text:** "Hi [Name]! This is [Your Name] from HobbyistApp. You're confirmed as founding partner #8! TestFlight invite coming within 2 hours. Text me with any questions!"

**You:** "Got it? Great. Here's a guide for your team about the benefits and timeline."

*[Hand over one-pager]*

---

## 🔄 HANDLING COMMON RESPONSES

### **"I need to think about it"**

**You:** "Totally understand! No pressure at all. Here's what I'll do - I'll reserve one of our founding spots for you until Friday. The form takes 60 seconds whenever you're ready."

*[Show QR code on business card]*

**You:** "Just scan this when you decide. But honestly, even if you're 50% interested, I'd grab the founding spot now - there's no commitment until you actually start using it, and you'd kick yourself if you missed the 50% lifetime discount."

---

### **"I need to check with my partner/team"**

**You:** "That makes perfect sense. How about this - let's get you registered for the founding partner spot now, which just reserves it. Then when you onboard next week, bring your partner and we'll walk through everything together."

**Alternative:** "Perfect! Let's at least get your basic info down so I can send you materials to share with them. Takes 30 seconds..."

*[Start filling form anyway]*

---

### **"How do I know this will work?"**

**You:** "Great question! That's exactly why we're doing this alpha program. You get to try it completely free for 6 months. If it doesn't increase your bookings, you've lost nothing. But when it does work - and our beta studios saw 35% revenue increase - you've locked in 50% off forever. It's basically a no-risk trial with massive upside."

---

### **"We already use [Competitor]"**

**You:** "That's actually perfect! About half our founding partners use [Competitor] too. We integrate alongside it, not replace it. You can test us with just your weekend workshops or new student offers. Then gradually transition if you like what you see. [Other Studio] is doing exactly that."

---

### **"We're too busy right now"**

**You:** "I hear that a lot, and ironically that's exactly why you need this - to save time. Tell you what - I'll put you on our 'white glove' onboarding list. That means I personally set everything up for you. You just approve and launch. Would that help?"

---

## 💡 PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS

### **During Signup:**

"Oh, actually let me check... *[pretend to check phone]* ...okay good, we still have 2 spots left."

**Social Proof:**
"[Nearby Studio] signed up yesterday and already uploaded their classes."

**Loss Aversion:**
"The founding partner pricing is never coming back after these 10 spots."

**Commitment Consistency:**
"Since you said your biggest challenge is booking management, this solves that exact problem."

**Authority:**
