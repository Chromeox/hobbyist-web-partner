## Red Flag Response Playbook

### If Crash Rate >3%
1. Halt new user onboarding immediately
2. Review Firebase/Sentry crash logs
3. Identify top 3 crash causes
4. Fix within 24-48 hours
5. Deploy hotfix via TestFlight
6. Resume onboarding only when <1%

### If Retention <50% by Day 7
1. Exit interviews with churned users (ask why)
2. Analyze drop-off points in funnel
3. Hypothesis: Onboarding too complex? Not enough classes? Booking friction?
4. A/B test fixes (simplified onboarding, better discovery, etc.)
5. Re-measure after 1 week

### If Zero Bookings After 3 Days
1. Test booking flow yourself end-to-end
2. Check Stripe integration (test payment)
3. Ask alpha testers directly: "Why haven't you booked?"
4. Look for UX blockers (confusing UI, hidden classes, etc.)
5. Fix immediately—bookings are the whole point

### If Studios Complaining
1. Call studio owner immediately (don't email)
2. Listen to complaint fully without defending
3. Offer immediate solution or workaround
4. Fix underlying issue within 48 hours
5. Follow up to confirm satisfaction
6. Learn: What systemic issue caused this?

## Final Thoughts on Metrics

### **Don't Vanity Metric Chase**
- Downloads ≠ Active Users
- Sign-ups ≠ Bookings
- Classes Listed ≠ Classes Booked
- Focus on engagement and revenue, not surface metrics

### **Context Matters**
- 25 active users in Week 1 is amazing
- 25 active users in Week 8 is concerning
- Compare to your targets, not other startups

### **Metrics Inform, Don't Dictate**
- Numbers tell you WHAT is happening
- Talk to users/studios to understand WHY
- Quantitative + Qualitative = Full picture

### **One Metric That Matters (OMTM)**
Each phase has one metric to obsess over:
- Week 1-3: Day 7 Retention (are users coming back?)
- Week 4-6: Bookings per User (are users engaging?)
- Week 7-8: LTV:CAC Ratio (is growth profitable?)

**Pick your OMTM, then move everything else to support it.**

**Tracking metrics is how you turn vision into reality. Review weekly, adjust fast, and celebrate progress! 📊🚀**
