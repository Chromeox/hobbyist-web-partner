## Email #8: Re-Engagement (For Inactive Testers)

**Subject:** Miss you! Everything okay with HobbyApp? 🤔

**Body:**

```
Hey [First Name],

I noticed you haven't been active on HobbyApp lately - just wanted
to check in!

Was there something that didn't work? Something confusing? Or just
haven't had time?

I'D LOVE YOUR HONEST FEEDBACK:
Even if you didn't love the app, your "why" helps me improve it.

• Was sign-up too complicated?
• Not enough classes in your area?
• Didn't see classes you were interested in?
• Technical issues (crashes, bugs)?
• Just busy / not the right timing?

REPLY WITH JUST ONE WORD:
What's the main reason you haven't used it?

No hard feelings if it's not for you - but your input is super valuable!

And hey, you still have $25 in credits. If you want to give it another
shot, I'm here to help make it a great experience.

Thanks for being part of alpha testing regardless!

[Your Name]

P.S. If I don't hear from you, I'll assume you're just busy and leave
you on our beta list for future updates. Sound good?

## Quick Response Templates (For Common Questions)

### "How do I use TestFlight?"
```
TestFlight is Apple's official app for testing apps before they're
publicly released!

Here's how:
1. Download TestFlight from App Store (it's free by Apple)
2. Open the invite link I sent you
3. Tap "Accept" then "Install"
4. HobbyApp will appear on your home screen like any app

Video guide: [Link to Apple's TestFlight guide]

Still stuck? Text me: [Your Phone]
```

### "My credits didn't load"
```
Hmm, let me check on that! Your $25 should have loaded automatically
when you signed up.

Can you check:
1. Open HobbyApp
2. Go to Profile tab (bottom right)
3. Look for "Credits: XX"

If it says 0, send me your email address and I'll manually add the
credits within 5 minutes.

Sorry for the hassle!
```

### "Can I bring a friend to alpha testing?"
```
Love the enthusiasm! Right now we're keeping alpha tight at 25-50
testers to ensure quality feedback.

BUT - if your friend is a perfect fit (creative professional, 25-40,
lives in Vancouver, loves trying new experiences), send me their
contact info and I'll consider adding them!

When we expand to beta (500 users) in 3-4 weeks, they'll be first
on the list.

Thanks for spreading the word!
```

### "What if I can't make the class I booked?"
```
No problem! Here's how to cancel:

1. Open HobbyApp
2. Go to "My Bookings" tab
3. Find your booking
4. Tap "Cancel Booking"
5. Your credits will be refunded instantly

CANCELLATION POLICY (for testing):
• 24+ hours before class: Full credit refund
• Less than 24 hours: 50% refund
• No-show: No refund

Since this is alpha testing, I'm flexible - if you have a legit reason,
just message me and I'll manually refund.

Questions? Text me: [Your Phone]

**Pro Tips for Sending Emails:**

1. **Personalize**: Use first names, reference their specific activity
2. **Keep it short**: Attention spans are short - get to the point
3. **Clear CTA**: Every email should have ONE clear next step
4. **Mobile-friendly**: Most will read on phone - short paragraphs
5. **Timing**: Send Tue-Thu 10am-2pm (best open rates)
6. **Follow-up**: If no response in 3 days, gentle nudge
7. **Celebrate wins**: Recognize their contributions
8. **Be human**: You're a founder, not a corporation
