## 🚶 Visiting Protocol

### Before Entering
1. **Scout the location**: Observe studio vibe through window
2. **Check timing**: Avoid during active classes (noise/distraction)
3. **Deep breath**: You're offering value, not selling
4. **Mindset**: You're a fellow creative entrepreneur, not a salesperson

### Best Times to Visit
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: 10am-12pm (after morning rush, before lunch)
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: 2pm-4pm (afternoon lull)
- **Avoid**: Mondays (slow start), Fridays (winding down), weekends (too busy)

### First Impression
- Smile and make eye contact
- Wait for natural pause in studio activity
- Approach front desk or visible staff member
- "Hi, I'm [Your Name]. Is the owner or manager available for 5 minutes?"

### If Owner Not Available
- "No problem! Can I leave some information and schedule a time to return?"
- Leave one-pager with business card attached
- Get owner's name and best contact method
- Note in tracking spreadsheet: "Owner not available - materials left"
- Follow up with email within 24 hours

## 🎯 The 10-Minute Pitch (Script)

### **Opening Hook** (30 seconds)
*[After introductions and confirming they have time]*

**You**: "I'm launching HobbyApp - Vancouver's first platform specifically for intro creative classes. We're recruiting 10 founding studio partners, and I'd love to show you how you could add $4,000 to $9,000 per month in revenue without any upfront cost."

**Goal**: Capture attention with specific revenue number

---

### **The Problem** (1 minute)
*[Establish pain point they already feel]*

**You**: "I'm curious - how do you currently attract new beginners to your classes?"

*[Let them answer - listen actively]*

Common responses:
- "Instagram, but it's hard to convert followers"
- "Word of mouth, but it's slow"
- "Google Ads, but they're expensive"
- "ClassPass, but the payout is terrible"

**You**: "Right, so you're either paying for customer acquisition through ads, or relying on slow organic growth. And with ClassPass, you're giving up 55% of revenue just to get discovered."

**Goal**: Validate their pain, show you understand their challenges

---

### **The Solution** (2 minutes)
*[Show app while explaining - visual + verbal]*

**You**: "HobbyApp flips that model. Instead of paying for customer acquisition, you get paid for it."

*[Open app on phone, show discovery feed]*

**You**: "Here's how it works: Curious learners browse intro classes across all Vancouver studios - pottery, cooking, dance, art. They buy credit packs and book classes with one tap. You teach the intro class like normal, and receive 70% of the credit value."

*[Tap on a sample class, show details page]*

**You**: "The magic is in the revenue share: You keep 70%. ClassPass keeps 55%, so you're getting 25 percentage points more. On $1,000 in bookings, that's $250 more in your pocket."

*[Tap 'Book' button, show checkout flow]*

**You**: "One-tap booking with Apple Pay. No friction. And here's the key: You keep all the customer contact information for follow-up. They came through HobbyApp, but they're YOUR customer now."

**Goal**: Clear value proposition with specific numbers + visual demo

---

### **The Opportunity** (1 minute)
*[Create urgency with founding partner offer]*

**You**: "We're launching alpha testing next week with 25 users, expanding to 500 within 8 weeks. I'm personally recruiting 10 founding studio partners who'll get:"

*[Count on fingers for emphasis]*

1. **"Free for 6 months** - that's $900 you're not paying"
2. **"50% off forever after** - $75 per month instead of $150"
3. **"Direct input on features** - you literally help design the platform"
4. **"Priority support** - my personal cell number for anything urgent"

**You**: "This offer is only for the first 10 studios. After that, it's standard pricing."

**Goal**: FOMO (fear of missing out) + exclusive partnership feeling

---

### **Social Proof** (30 seconds - if applicable)
*[If you have alpha studio commitments, mention them]*

**You**: "I'm already talking with [Studio Name] and [Studio Name] - both are excited about the beginner acquisition potential."

OR if earlier in process:

**You**: "I've modeled this on ClassPass but with Vancouver-first focus and fair revenue share. The economics work for studios from day one - you're profitable on every intro session."

**Goal**: Reduce risk perception with validation

---

### **The Ask** (30 seconds)
*[Don't leave it vague - specific next step]*

**You**: "I'd love to have you as a founding partner. The whole setup takes about 10 minutes - list 2-3 beginner classes, set pricing, and you're live. Can we schedule 15 minutes this week for me to walk you through the Partner Portal?"

*[Pull out phone, show calendar]*

**You**: "I'm free Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. What works better for you?"

**Goal**: Concrete next step = meeting scheduled

---

## 🛡️ Objection Handling

### Objection: "We're already on ClassPass/Mindbody"
**Response**: "That's great - you already understand the value of being discovered online. The difference is HobbyApp gives you 25 percentage points more revenue AND keeps you top of mind with Vancouver locals specifically. You can be on both - they complement each other."

**Why It Works**: Acknowledges their existing solution, positions as additive not replacement

---

### Objection: "We don't need more marketing right now"
**Response**: "Totally understand. Just to clarify - this isn't marketing you pay for. This is customer acquisition you GET PAID for. You teach intro classes anyway, right? HobbyApp just fills those spots and pays you 70% to do it. Zero cost to you."

**Why It Works**: Reframes from cost center to revenue center

---

### Objection: "I need to talk to my business partner/accountant"
**Response**: "Of course! Here's a one-pager with all the details including the economics breakdown. What if I email you tomorrow with a quick 3-minute video walking through the platform? Then you and your partner can review together and we can chat Friday."

**Why It Works**: Respects decision-making process, provides materials for internal discussion, maintains momentum with follow-up plan

---

### Objection: "We're too busy right now"
**Response**: "I hear you - that's actually WHY this works. You don't change anything about how you teach. We handle all the marketing, booking, payments. You just show up and teach like normal. The whole setup is 10 minutes, then it runs on autopilot."

**Why It Works**: Acknowledges their constraint, emphasizes low time commitment

---

### Objection: "How do I know this will work?"
**Response**: "Fair question. Here's how we're mitigating risk: You pay nothing upfront. No monthly fees for 6 months. If it doesn't drive students, you cancel anytime. But here's my confidence: I've modeled this on proven marketplace dynamics - ClassPass does $300M+ annually because the model works. We just made it fair for studios."

**Why It Works**: Demonstrates risk-free trial, cites proven model, shows confidence

---

### Objection: "What if the app doesn't take off?"
**Response**: "I appreciate that concern. Here's my commitment: I'm running alpha testing with 25 hand-recruited users next week, scaling to 500 within 8 weeks through paid ads and organic growth. You'll see activity within the first month or I'll personally comp your monthly fee even after the free period ends. I'm that confident."

**Why It Works**: Shows concrete traction plan + personal guarantee demonstrates skin in the game

---

### Objection: "Our classes are already full"
**Response**: "That's a great problem to have! Two thoughts: First, HobbyApp helps you fill mid-week or off-peak slots that aren't full. Second, as you scale or add new instructors, you'll have immediate demand lined up. And worst case - you can list classes and simply mark popular times as sold out. You're still visible to future students."

**Why It Works**: Addresses immediate concern, plants seed for future growth

---

### Objection: "I don't like technology/online booking"
**Response**: "I totally get it - you got into this to teach [pottery/cooking/etc.], not manage tech. That's exactly why I made the Partner Portal super simple. Three fields: class name, date/time, price. That's it. And if you ever get stuck, you have my personal number. I'll walk you through every step."

**Why It Works**: Empathizes with technophobia, emphasizes simplicity + personal support

---

## 📱 The Demo (2 Minutes)

### **Discovery Feed**
*[Open app, show main feed]*

- "This is what learners see first - local intro classes across all categories"
- "Notice it's visual, Instagram-like. People browse by vibe, not spreadsheets"
- "Your studio gets beautiful photos, reviews, and easy filtering"

### **Class Detail Page**
*[Tap on a sample class]*

- "Here's a class detail page - instructor name, what they'll learn, materials included"
- "Reviews from past attendees build trust"
- "One-tap booking - no forms, no friction"

### **Studio Profile**
*[Navigate to studio profile]*

- "This is YOUR studio page - all your intro classes in one place"
- "Learners can follow you for updates"
- "Your existing social media links here for organic follow-back"

### **Booking Flow**
*[Tap 'Book' button]*

- "Apple Pay one-tap checkout"
- "They get confirmation with your studio address, parking info, what to bring"
- "YOU get their contact info for email list building"

### **Partner Portal** (If on laptop/iPad)
*[Open partner portal website]*

- "This is your dashboard - create classes, see bookings, track revenue"
- "Takes 10 minutes to list your first class"
- "Auto-calculates your 70% payout weekly"

**Goal**: Make it tangible and easy to visualize

## 🎭 Role-Play Scenarios (Practice Before Visiting)

### Scenario 1: The Busy Owner
**Owner**: *[Multitasking, barely looks up]* "Yeah, what's this about?"

**You**: *[Friendly but direct]* "I'll be super quick - 2 minutes. I'm recruiting 10 Vancouver studios for a new platform that pays YOU to bring in beginner students. Would $4,000-$9,000 extra monthly revenue with zero upfront cost be interesting?"

**Goal**: Respect their time, lead with money, create curiosity

---

### Scenario 2: The Skeptic
**Owner**: "I've heard pitches like this before. What makes you different?"

**You**: *[Acknowledge, differentiate]* "Fair question. Three things: One, we're Vancouver-only, not trying to be global ClassPass. Two, you keep 70% not 45%. Three, I'm a local founder you can text directly, not a faceless corporation. But I get it - talk is cheap. How about this: Zero cost trial. If you don't see students in 30 days, walk away. Deal?"

**Goal**: Validate skepticism, differentiate clearly, reduce risk

---

### Scenario 3: The Enthusiast
**Owner**: "This sounds amazing! How do I sign up right now?"

**You**: *[Match enthusiasm, but set realistic expectations]* "Love the energy! Here's what I'd recommend: Let's schedule 15 minutes tomorrow for me to walk you through the Partner Portal. You'll list 2-3 classes, I'll make sure photos look great, and we'll launch together when alpha testing starts next week. That way you're fully set up for success. Does tomorrow at 2pm work?"

**Goal**: Channel enthusiasm into structured next step, avoid rushed onboarding

---

## 🎓 Pro Tips from Sales Veterans

1. **The first 30 seconds matter most**: Nail your opening hook
2. **Questions > Statements**: Let them talk about their challenges
3. **Show, don't just tell**: Demo the app while explaining
4. **Specific beats vague**: "$4,000 extra monthly" > "make more money"
5. **Leave on a high note**: "Great chatting!" even if no immediate interest
6. **Follow up religiously**: 80% of deals happen in the follow-up
7. **Track everything**: You'll forget details within hours
8. **Batch visits geographically**: Save time and energy
9. **Visit at off-peak times**: Busy owners won't have time
10. **Believe in your product**: Confidence is contagious

**You're ready! Now go get those founding partners! 💪**

*Remember: Every founder started exactly where you are. The only difference between success and failure is taking the first step.*
