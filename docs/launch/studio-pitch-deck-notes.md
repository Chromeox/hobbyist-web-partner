## Slide 1: The Problem & Opportunity

### **What's On The Slide:**
- Title: "Vancouver Studios Need Better Customer Acquisition"
- Visual: Comparison chart showing ClassPass (45% to studio) vs HobbyApp (70% to studio)
- Key stat: "$250 more per $1,000 in bookings"

### **What You Say** (60 seconds):

**Opening:**
"Let me show you why studios love HobbyApp..."

**Point to comparison visual:**
"Right now, if you're on ClassPass, you're giving away 55% of revenue just to be discovered. On $1,000 in bookings, that's $450 to ClassPass, $550 to you."

**Point to HobbyApp side:**
"HobbyApp flips that: You keep 70%, we keep 30%. Same $1,000 in bookings, you get $700. That's $250 more in your pocket—and you still own the customer relationship."

**Bridge to next slide:**
"Here's how the economics work..."

### **Common Interruptions & Responses:**

**Owner:** "But ClassPass brings high volume..."
**You:** "That's true, and you can stay on ClassPass! We're not asking you to choose. HobbyApp is additive—different customer base, better margins. Many studios use both."

**Owner:** "How do I know you'll bring customers?"
**You:** "Great question—that's exactly what the founding partner program proves. We're launching with 25 alpha testers next week, scaling to 500 in 8 weeks. You'll see bookings within the first month or I'll personally comp your fees. That's my guarantee."

## Slide 2: How HobbyApp Works

### **What's On The Slide:**
- Title: "The HobbyApp Model"
- Three-step visual flow:
  1. Learners browse & book intro classes
  2. Studios teach intro sessions (paid 70%)
  3. Studios convert intro students to full courses
- Revenue flow diagram

### **What You Say** (90 seconds):

**Point to Step 1:**
"Here's the magic: Curious learners browse intro classes across all Vancouver studios—pottery, cooking, dance, art. They buy credit packs ($25, $50, $90) and book with one tap. No friction."

**Point to Step 2:**
"You teach the intro class like normal. Maybe it's a 2-hour beginner pottery wheel session, priced at $35. They use their credits to book. You receive 70%—that's $24.50—within 7 days via direct deposit."

**Point to Step 3:**
"Here's the key: That intro student is now YOUR customer. You have their email, their contact info. Your job is to convert them into a full 6-week course, private lessons, or repeat classes. Industry average conversion is 15-35%."

**Do the math out loud:**
"So if you get 50 intro sessions per month at $25 average—that's $875 direct revenue just from intros. If 25% convert to a $200 course, that's another $2,500. Total impact: $3,375 per month, or $40,500 annually. From one partnership."

**Bridge to next slide:**
"And as a founding partner, here's what you get..."

### **Common Interruptions & Responses:**

**Owner:** "What if they don't come back after the intro?"
**You:** "That's normal—studios average 20-30% conversion from intro to full course. But even at 15%, the math works. You're getting paid $25 per intro. If one in seven converts to a $200 course, you're still way ahead. Plus, you're not paying for ads to get them in the door."

**Owner:** "How do I price my intro classes?"
**You:** "Great question. Most studios price intro classes at $18-35 depending on materials and length. Pottery with clay included: $25-35. Cooking class with meal: $30-40. We recommend starting at your typical drop-in rate, then adjusting based on demand."

## Slide 3: Founding Partner Benefits

### **What's On The Slide:**
- Title: "Join as a Founding Partner"
- Bullet list:
  - Free for 6 months ($900 value)
  - 50% off forever after ($75/month vs $150)
  - Direct input on platform features
  - Priority support (founder's personal line)
  - Limited to first 10 studios
- Call-to-action: "Let's get you set up"

### **What You Say** (60 seconds):

**Set the exclusivity:**
"I'm personally recruiting 10 founding partner studios—not 100, not 50—just 10. Why? Because I want to work closely with you, get feedback, and build this platform FOR you, not TO you."

**Walk through benefits:**

**Point to first bullet:**
"As a founding partner, you pay nothing for 6 months. Standard pricing is $150/month, so that's $900 you save. After 6 months, you're locked in at 50% off forever—$75/month for life."

**Point to third bullet:**
"You'll literally help design features. Need a waitlist? Tell me. Want class series? I'll build it. You're not just a customer, you're a co-creator."

**Point to fourth bullet:**
"And you'll have my personal cell number. If something breaks at 8pm before your class tomorrow, text me. I'll fix it. You won't get that from Mindbody or ClassPass."

**Create urgency:**
"I've already got interest from [mention any studios if applicable, or say 'three studios in East Van']. Spots are filling up. Once we hit 10, it's standard pricing—no exceptions."

**The ask:**
"I'd love to have [Studio Name] as a founding partner. Setup takes 10 minutes. Can we schedule 15 minutes this week to walk through the Partner Portal together?"

**Pull out phone, show availability:**
"I'm free Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. What works better for you?"

### **Common Interruptions & Responses:**

**Owner:** "I need to think about it / talk to my business partner..."
**You:** "Of course! I totally understand. Here's what I'll do: I'll email you tonight with a video walkthrough of the Partner Portal so you and your partner can review it together. Then let's chat Friday afternoon—does 2pm work?"

**Owner:** "What happens after the 6 months?"
**You:** "Great question. After 6 months, you're automatically on the founding partner rate of $75/month. You can cancel anytime with 30 days notice—no long-term contracts. But honestly, if you're getting $500-2,000/month in bookings, $75 is a no-brainer ROI."

**Owner:** "What if I want to cancel before 6 months?"
**You:** "You can cancel anytime, zero penalty. I'm that confident you'll love it. This isn't a trap—it's a genuine partnership."

## Deck Presentation Tips

### Before Presenting
1. **Know your numbers cold**: 70% vs 45%, $250 more, 6 months free, $75/month
2. **Practice out loud**: Say the pitch 10 times at home before first visit
3. **Anticipate objections**: Rehearse responses to common questions
4. **Be confident but humble**: You're offering value, not begging

### During Presentation
1. **Make eye contact**: Don't read from slides—glance and explain
2. **Use hands**: Point to visuals while explaining
3. **Pause for questions**: Don't rush—let them absorb
4. **Watch body language**: Crossed arms = skeptical, leaning in = interested
5. **Match their energy**: Enthusiastic owner? Be enthusiastic. Cautious owner? Be measured and detail-oriented.

### After Presenting
1. **Shut up and listen**: After the ask ("Can we schedule 15 minutes?"), STOP TALKING. Let them respond.
2. **Don't oversell**: If they say yes, great! If they say maybe, respect it.
3. **Always leave materials**: Even if they say no, leave one-pager—they might change their mind.
4. **Follow up religiously**: Promised email in 24 hours? Send in 23 hours.

## Deck Variations by Studio Type

### **For High-Volume Studios** (e.g., big fitness studio)
- Emphasize: "50-100 intro sessions/month = $4K-9K monthly revenue"
- Emphasize: "We handle all marketing, you handle class delivery"
- Downplay: Feature customization (they care more about volume)

### **For Artisan Studios** (e.g., small pottery studio)
- Emphasize: "Keep your customer relationships—we're just the discovery layer"
- Emphasize: "Quality students who genuinely want to learn your craft"
- Emphasize: "Direct input on platform design—you shape the product"

### **For Multi-Category Studios** (e.g., arts collective)
- Emphasize: "List all your different class types—pottery, painting, sculpture"
- Emphasize: "Cross-promotion opportunity—students discover other classes"
- Emphasize: "One platform for your entire schedule"

### **For Skeptical Studios** (e.g., already burned by platforms)
- Emphasize: "Zero upfront cost—only pay if it works"
- Emphasize: "I'm a local founder, not a corporation—you have my personal cell"
- Emphasize: "Cancel anytime, no penalty—this is risk-free"

## Red Flags (When to Walk Away)

Sometimes a studio isn't a good fit. Look for:
- ❌ **Hostile attitude**: Rude, dismissive, aggressive (not worth your time)
- ❌ **No beginner classes**: Advanced-only studios don't fit our model
- ❌ **Unrealistic demands**: "I want 90% revenue share" (economics don't work)
- ❌ **Chronically unavailable**: Won't make time, reschedules 3+ times (not serious)
- ❌ **Bad online reputation**: <3 star reviews, fraud complaints (brand risk)

**It's okay to say:** "Thanks for your time, but I don't think we're the right fit right now. Best of luck!"

**Why walk away:** 10 great partners > 20 mediocre partners. Quality over quantity.

---

## Success Stories to Reference (As You Get Them)

### **After First Studio Signs**
"[Studio Name] in East Van just joined as a founding partner—they saw the value of 70% revenue share immediately."

### **After First Booking**
"We've already had [X] bookings in the first week of alpha testing."

### **After First Testimonial**
"Here's what [Studio Owner Name] said after their first month: '[Quote]'"

**Build social proof incrementally.** Each win makes the next pitch easier.

---

## Confidence Builders (For Your Own Nerves)

### **Before Your First Visit:**
- "I'm offering value, not asking for a favor"
- "The worst they can say is no—and that just means they're not ready yet"
- "Every founder has done this. I'm not special, but I'm doing it."

### **After a Rejection:**
- "That's one more studio that wasn't a fit—now I'm closer to the right ones"
- "Rejection is data: What objection did they raise? How can I address it better next time?"
- "Even Airbnb heard 'no' 1,000 times before their first 'yes'"

### **After a Success:**
- "That's one founding partner down—I'm 10% there!"
- "They believed in the vision—that's validation"
- "Each yes makes the next pitch easier with social proof"
