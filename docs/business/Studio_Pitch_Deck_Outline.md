## 📊 **Slide 1: The Problem & Opportunity**

### **Content:**
**"Vancouver's Creative Studios Are Missing Revenue"**

**Customer Pain Points:**
- Hard to discover new creative classes
- Booking systems are clunky or non-existent  
- No central place to explore Vancouver's creative scene

**Studio Pain Points:**
- 30-50% empty seats in classes
- Marketing costs eat into profits
- ClassPass takes 55% commission
- No direct relationship with new customers

**The Opportunity:**
- **650,000 Vancouverites** looking for creative experiences
- **$15M+ market** for pottery, cooking, dance, art classes
- **Post-pandemic hobby boom** - people prioritizing mental health

## 💰 **Slide 2: HobbyApp Solution & Your Revenue**

### **Visual:** Revenue comparison chart showing HobbyApp vs ClassPass

### **Content:**
**"Earn 70% On Every Booking - That's $250 More Per $1,000 vs ClassPass"**

**Revenue Comparison:**
```
$1,000 in Bookings:
• ClassPass: You get $450 (they take 55%)
• HobbyApp: You get $700 (we take 30%)
• Extra income: $250 more with HobbyApp
```

**How It Works:**
- **Students buy credit packs** ($25, $50, $90)
- **Classes cost 20-40 credits** (you set requirements)
- **You get 70% immediately** - no waiting for payouts

## 📋 **Pitch Delivery Tips**

### **Opening (30 seconds):**
*"Hi [Name], I'm Kurt, I've built a platform that could put an extra $3,000+ per month in your pocket by filling your empty class seats. Can I show you a quick 3-minute overview?"*

### **Key Phrases to Use:**
- **"25 percentage points better than ClassPass"**
- **"You keep 70% - that's $700 on every $1,000"**
- **"Local Vancouver focus, not global competition"**
- **"Cash upfront with credit system"**
- **"We're launching with 50 alpha testers next week"**

### **Handling Objections:**
**"We're too busy"** → *"This actually reduces work - we handle all customer service and marketing"*

**"We don't like ClassPass"** → *"That's exactly why we built this - 70% vs their 45%"*

**"Technology is complicated"** → *"Partner portal is simpler than Instagram - let me show you"*

**"What if it doesn't work?"** → *"Trial period with alpha testers - no risk, just upside"*

### **Closing:**
*"Look, I've spent 6 months building this because I believe Vancouver's creative community deserves better than ClassPass. You'd be one of our founding partners - and frankly, at 70% revenue share, you can't afford not to try this. Can we do a 2-week trial?"*
