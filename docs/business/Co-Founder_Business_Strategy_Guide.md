# 💼 **Co-Founder & Business Strategy - Practical Advice**

---

## 🤝 **Co-Founder Equity (The Real Numbers)**

### **Standard Equity Splits:**
- **50/50 split** is NOT automatic - it depends on what they bring
- **Technical founder (you)** typically retains more equity since you built everything
- **Realistic ranges:**
  - You: 60-70% | Co-founder: 30-40% (if they bring capital + business skills)
  - You: 70-80% | Co-founder: 20-30% (if they bring only business skills)
  - You: 55-65% | Co-founder: 35-45% (if they bring significant capital)

### **What Those Business Owners Could Bring:**
- **Local studio connections** (massive value for you)
- **Marketing/sales expertise** you lack
- **Business operations** knowledge
- **Capital** for initial marketing spend
- **Credibility** with Vancouver business community

**My Take:** Talk to them, but **don't agree to anything over 40%** unless they're investing significant cash ($50k+).

## 📋 **NDAs - When and Why**

### **Studios: YES, Use NDAs**
- **Why:** Protects your commission model and studio partnership strategy
- **When:** Before showing partner portal or discussing revenue splits
- **Template:** Simple 1-page mutual NDA (find templates online)

### **Alpha Testers: NO NDAs Needed**
- They're testing user experience, not business strategy
- Too formal for alpha testing phase
- Focus on getting feedback, not protecting secrets

### **Business Partners: YES, Detailed NDAs**
- Especially if discussing financial projections
- Include non-compete clauses for Vancouver market
- Get lawyer review ($500-1000 investment worth it)

## 💰 **Alpha Testing Budget Reality**

### **Credit Costs for Alpha Testing:**

**Option 1: Full Coverage (Recommended)**
- Give each tester $25 credit pack (25 credits)
- 50 testers × $25 = **$1,250 out of pocket**
- Studios get 70% = **$875 to studios, $375 to you**
- **Net cost to you: $875** for comprehensive testing

**Option 2: Partial Coverage**
- Give each tester $10 in credits (10 credits)
- 50 testers × $10 = **$500 out of pocket**
- **Net cost to you: $350** but less comprehensive testing

**Option 3: Studio Partnership**
- Negotiate with 3 studios to offer free intro classes for alpha testing
- You pay studio $15/class directly
- **Net cost: $750** but builds studio relationships

### **My Recommendation: Option 1**
- **$875 investment** for quality feedback is reasonable
- Shows commitment to both testers and studios
- Generates real revenue data for investors
- Tests full payment flow end-to-end

## 🎯 **Strategic Approach for Next Month**

### **Week 1: Business Development**
1. **Contact those 2 business owners** this week
   - Position as "advisor/partner" conversation, not equity discussion
   - Ask for 30-min coffee to discuss Vancouver creative market
   - Gauge their interest and what they'd bring

2. **Prepare simple NDA template**
   - Use LegalTemplates.net or similar
   - Keep it simple - 1 page max

### **Week 2-3: Alpha Testing Prep**
1. **Budget $1,000** for alpha testing costs
2. **Recruit 25 testers** first (not 50) - easier to manage
3. **Identify 3 partner studios** willing to participate

### **Week 4: TestFlight Launch**
1. **Submit to TestFlight** 
2. **Start alpha testing** with credit allocation
3. **Begin studio outreach** while app is being tested

## 🤔 **Should You Take on a Co-Founder?**

### **YES, IF they bring:**
- **Studio connections** (can get you 10+ partnerships quickly)
- **Marketing expertise** (proven track record with local businesses)
- **Capital** ($25k+ to fund user acquisition)
- **Operations experience** (can handle customer support, studio relations)

### **NO, IF they only offer:**
- "Business advice" without specific skills
- "Connections" they can't prove
- Wanting equal equity for minimal contribution
- No skin in the game (time or money)

### **Alternative: Advisory Equity**
- Give 2-5% equity for specific help (studio introductions, marketing strategy)
- No voting rights, just financial upside
- Less commitment, easier to manage

## 💡 **Immediate Action Plan**

### **This Week:**
1. **Call those 2 business owners** - schedule coffee meetings
2. **Set aside $1,000** for alpha testing budget
3. **Create simple NDA template**
4. **List 10 studios** you want to approach first

### **Next Week:**
1. **Meet with potential advisors/partners**
2. **Submit TestFlight application**
3. **Start recruiting alpha testers** from your network
4. **Prepare studio pitch deck** (3 slides max)

## 🎯 **Bottom Line**

**Co-founder decision:** Meet with them first, but keep equity <40% unless they bring serious value.

**NDAs:** Use them for studios and partners, skip for alpha testers.

**Alpha budget:** $875 investment is worth it for quality testing and real data.

**Priority:** Get TestFlight live, then figure out partnerships. You're 99% complete - don't let business decisions slow down your technical momentum.

**Focus on shipping first, optimizing partnerships second.** You can always adjust equity and partnerships after you have real user data and revenue.
