🍎 APPLE SIGN IN - PROVISIONING PROFILE FIX
==========================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Your Release provisioning profile is missing the "com.apple.developer.in-app-purchase" entitlement, which is required for Apple Sign In to work properly.

SOLUTION - Regenerate Provisioning Profile:

1. Go to Apple Developer Console:
   https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list

2. Find your Release provisioning profile for "com.hobbyist.bookingapp"

3. Delete the current Release profile (it's broken)

4. Create a NEW Release provisioning profile:
   - Name: "HobbyistSwiftUI Release"
   - App ID: com.hobbyist.bookingapp
   - Certificates: Your distribution certificate
   - Devices: All your registered devices
   - IMPORTANT: Make sure it includes these capabilities:
     ✅ Sign In with Apple
     ✅ In-App Purchase
     ✅ App Groups (group.com.hobbyist.app)
     ✅ Push Notifications

5. Download the new provisioning profile

6. In Xcode:
   - Go to Signing & Capabilities tab
   - For Release configuration: "Automatically manage signing" OFF
   - Import the new provisioning profile
   - Select it for Release builds

ALTERNATIVE (EASIER):
1. In Xcode, go to Signing & Capabilities
2. For Release configuration, turn ON "Automatically manage signing"
3. This will auto-generate a new profile with all required entitlements

WHY THIS FIXES THE ISSUE:
- Apple Sign In requires the In-App Purchase entitlement to validate tokens
- Your current Release profile is missing this entitlement
- The Debug profile works because it has the entitlement
- Regenerating the profile will include all entitlements from your .entitlements file

AFTER FIXING:
- Clean build your project (Cmd+Shift+K)
- Test Apple Sign In again
- The audience mismatch error should be resolved
